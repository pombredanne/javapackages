NAME
----
shade-jar - rename Java namespace in JAR file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*bin/shade-jar* *orig-namespace* *shaded-namespace* *in-jar* *out-jar*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*shade-jar* utility is means for changing JAR file namespaces.
Basically it replaces all occurences of given pattern with a given
replacement.  The replacament is performed on class file names and
inside the class files themselves.  This is commonly known as
_shading_.

EXAMPLES
--------
*shade-jar org.apache.log4j com.example.shaded.log4j
/usr/share/java/log4j.jar lib/shaded-log4j.jar* will replace all
occurences of *org.apache.log4j* in JAR file
*/usr/share/java/log4j.jar* with *com.example.shaded.log4j* and store
the resulting JAR in *lib/shaded-log4j.jar*.

BUGS
----
Currently only class files are shaded.  Resources are not renamed.
Neither contents of resource files nor manifests are processed.
