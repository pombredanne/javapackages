NAME
----
mvn_file - set installation location(s) for Maven artifact(s)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%mvn_file* artifact-coordinates primary-file [secondary-file ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mvn_file* macro causes instructions for artifact installation to be
added to XMvn reactor configuration.  It is used to control locations
of artifact files in file system.  (The exact meaning of artifact
location is dependant on particular implementation of XMvn repository
into which artifacts will be installed.)

Specified artifact coordinates must match at least one artifact.  If
not then behavior is unspecified.  It is possible to specify artifact
coordinates matching multiple artifacts, so one call to *mvn_file* can
affect installation of more than one artifact.

OPERANDS
--------
*artifact-coordinates*::
    Artifact coordinates specify artifact(s) that this rule applies
    to.  Coordinates are in format
    *groupId:artifactId[:extension[:classifier]][:version]*.  If
    extension is specified then version must be specified too.  If any
    part is omitted or equal to empty string then it matches any
    string.  Wildcards and brace expansions are supported in each
    part.  For more information see XMvn Configuration Reference.

*primary-file*::
    Primary location of artifact file.  This operand is passed
    directly to XMvn installer.  Its exact meaning is specific to
    particular repository implementation used to install given
    artifact.  Backreferences are supported in form *@n*, where *n* is
    an integer corresponding to brace in *artifact-coordinates*.

*secondary-file*::
    Secondary location of artifact file.  There can be any number
    (zero or more) of secondary artifact files.  These operands are
    passed directly to XMvn installer.  Their exact meaning is
    specific to particular repository implementation used to install
    given artifact.  Backreferences are supported in form *@n*, where
    *n* is an integer corresponding to brace in
    *artifact-coordinates*.
