NAME
----
pom_change_dep - change dependency in Maven POM file or Ivy module

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%pom_change_dep* [OPTIONS] SOURCE_ARTIFACT CHANGED_ARTIFACT [POM-location]...
    [extra-XML]

*%pom_change_dep* [OPTIONS] SOURCE_ARTIFACT CHANGED_ARTIFACT
    [Ivy-module-location]... [extra-XML]

OPTIONS
-------

*-r*::
Work in recursive mode. That means that given dependency is also changed
in all enabled submodules of given POM file(s). Has no effect if the
file is not Maven POM.

*-f*::
Do not throw an error when one of the specified files doesn't contain
given dependency.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
These macros patch specified POM or Ivy file changing a dependency on
given Maven artifact specified by artifact coordinates to artifact
specified by second set of Maven coordinates. The artifact specification
has same format as *%pom_add_dep*. The omitted or empty parts in second
artifact specification cause the original value to be left unmodified.
Supplying a special value of *-* for given part causes that part of
artifact specification to be deleted.

POM location can be either a full path to the POM or Ivy file, or a path
to the directory containing *pom.xml* or *ivy.xml*.  If POM location is
not given then *pom.xml* or *ivy.xml* from current working directory is
used. When both *pom.xml* and *ivy.xml* are present, *pom.xml* is
processed. You can specify more file locations which will be processed.

Extra XML is additional XML code to be added into the *<dependency>*
node. This parameter can be ommited, in which case no extra XML is
appended.

EXAMPLES
--------
*pom_change_dep foo: com.example.foo:* - this call changes groupId of
all dependencies which have groupId foo to com.example.foo. Their
artifactId, versions and other possible parts are left unmodified.
