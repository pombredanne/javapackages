NAME
----
mvn_package - specify target package for Maven artifact(s)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%mvn_package* artifact-coordinates [target-package]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mvn_package* macro causes instructions for artifact installation to
be added to XMvn reactor configuration.  It is used to specify target
package to which Maven artifacts should be installed.

Specified artifact coordinates must match at least one artifact.  If
not then behavior is unspecified.  It is possible to specify artifact
coordinates matching multiple artifacts, so one call to *mvn_package*
can affect installation of more than one artifact.

OPERANDS
--------
*artifact-coordinates*::
    Artifact coordinates specify artifact(s) that this rule applies
    to.  Coordinates are in format
    *groupId:artifactId[:extension[:classifier]][:version]*.  If
    extension is specified then version must be specified too.  If any
    part is omitted or equal to empty string then it matches any
    string.  Wildcards and brace expansions are supported in each
    part.  For more information see XMvn Configuration Reference.

*target-package*::
    Name of target (sub-)package to which matching artifacts will be
    installed.  Backreferences are supported in form *@n*, where *n*
    is an integer corresponding to brace in *artifact-coordinates*.  A
    special value of *__noinstall* means that matching artifact(s)
    should not be installed to any package. Special value of *__default*
    means that matching artifact(s) should be installed into main package.
    If target-package is omitted value of *__default* is assumed.
