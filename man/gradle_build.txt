NAME
----
gradle_build - build Gradle project in offline, local mode

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%gradle_build* [options] [-- Gradle-arguments]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*gradle_build* macro builds Gradle project and generates reactor
structure information to be used by *mvn_install*.

By default Gradle goal *build* is executed, as well as some additional
XMvn-specific tasks.  If *-f* is specified then goal *assemble* is
executed instead of *build*.

Any arguments after *--* are passed directly to Gradle.  See
*gradle(1)* for more information on availability of Gradle options.

OPTIONS
-------
*-d, --xmvn-debug*::
    Enable XMvn debugging output.  This option causes XMvn to write
    verbose debugging information to standard output.  Debugging
    information includes at least details about artifact resolution
    from system repositories.

*-f, --force*::
    Skip compilation and execution of unit and integration tests.  This
    option causes Gradle goal *assemble* to be executed instead of
    default goal *build*.

*-i, --skip-install*::
    Skip artifact installation.  This option disables generation of
    reactor structure information so that future calls to
    *mvn_install* will not result in installation of artifacts
    produced in current Maven reactor.

*-j, --skip-javadoc*::
    Accepted for compatibility with `%mvn_build`, but otherwise
    ignored.

*-s, --singleton*::
    Enable singleton packaging (one artifact per package).  This
    option causes artifacts with identical *artifactId* to be
    installed as part of the same subpackage.  This behavior can be
    further customized by adding more specific packaging rules with
    *mvn_package*.

*-X, --debug*::
    Enable Maven debugging output.  Implies *-d*.  This option causes
    Gradle to write verbose debugging information to standard output.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*xmvn_bootstrap*::
    Run XMvn in online mode.  If *xmvn_bootstrap* RPM macro is defined
    to any value then Gradle is ran in online mode.  Otherwise Gradle
    is ran in offline mode.  Online mode of Gradle allows missing
    dependency artifacts to be fetched from remote repositories.  This
    behavior is mostly useful when bootstrapping new packages, which
    dependecies have not yet been packaged.
