NAME
----
build-classpath - build a Java CLASSPATH

SYNOPSIS
--------
*build-classpath* JAR|artifact-coordinates [JAR|artifact-coordinates ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Small utility to build a Java CLASSPATH with the named JARs or Maven artifact
coordinates.  Artifact coordinates specify Maven artifact and are in format
*groupId:artifactId[:extension[:classifier]]:version*. If extension is omitted
then "jar" is used.  If classifier is omitted then empty classifier is used. For
more information see XMvn Configuration Reference. The CLASSPATH is returned to
standard output.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
Using *build-classpath* with artifact-coordinates requires
*xmvn-resolve* command to be available. User of *build-classpath* is
responsible for making it available in the system.

EXAMPLES
--------
*build-classpath junit xerces-j2 wsdl4j* - this will return a string to standard out
that is a valid CLASSPATH containing junit, xerces-j2, and wsdl4j JARs.

*build-classpath log4j:log4j org.apache.commons:commons-io* - this will return a
string to standard out that is a valid CLASSPATH containing log4j and commons-io
JARs.

*build-classpath com.google.inject:guice::no_aop:* - this will return a string
to standard out that is a valid CLASSPATH containing google-guice JAR with
classifier no_aop.
