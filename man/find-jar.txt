NAME
----
find-jar - find extension JAR or directory

SYNOPSIS
--------
*find-jar* JAR|artifact-coordinates

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *find-jar* command tests the resolution of a given element.  If
successful it will return a JAR file or a directory.

This command is solely intended for testing resolution and should not
be used in scripts.  Even for single-element classpath building
*build-classpath* is preferred since single-element searches can
produce multiple file results when resolving into a directory.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
Using *find-jar* with artifact-coordinates requires *xmvn-resolve*
command to be available. User of *find-jar* is responsible for making
it available in the system.

EXAMPLES
--------
*find-jar xpp3* will print */usr/share/java/xpp3.jar* on standard
output.

*find-jar javamail* will print */usr/share/java/javamail* on standard
output.

REPORTING BUGS
--------------
Bugs should be reported through Java Pacakges Tools issue tracker at
Github: https://github.com/fedora-java/javapackages/issues.
