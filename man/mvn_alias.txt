NAME
----
mvn_alias - add alias(es) for Maven artifact(s)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%mvn_alias* artifact-coordinates alias [alias ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mvn_alias* macro causes instructions for artifact installation to be
added to XMvn reactor configuration.  It is used to specify
alternative names (aliases) for Maven artifacts.

Specified artifact coordinates must match at least one artifact.  If
not then behavior is unspecified.  It is possible to specify artifact
coordinates matching multiple artifacts, so one call to *mvn_alias*
can affect installation of more than one artifact.

OPERANDS
--------
*artifact-coordinates*::
    Artifact coordinates specify artifact(s) that this rule applies
    to.  Coordinates are in format
    *groupId:artifactId[:extension[:classifier]][:version]*.  If
    extension is specified then version must be specified too.  If any
    part is omitted or equal to empty string then it matches any
    string.  Wildcards and brace expansions are supported in each
    part.  For more information see XMvn Configuration Reference.

*alias*::
    Coordinates specifying artifact alias (alternative name under
    which matching artifacts will be available).  Coordinates are in
    format *groupId:artifactId[:extension[:classifier]][:version]*.
    If extension is specified then version must be specified too.  If
    any part is omitted or equal to empty string then corresponding
    part from *artifact-coordinates* will be substituted.
    Backreferences are supported in form *@n*, where *n* is an integer
    corresponding to brace in *artifact-coordinates*.
